Instructions from Nate:
- I would like would be a home page, portfolio, bio/profile, and links to my IG, FB, and Etsy.
- Color pallette: black, greys, browns, and gold

I’m attaching my logo in all of the formats that I have, as well as pictures of pieces that I’ve done, focusing on the woodburning/pyrography for now.

To do list:
- Come up with defined hex colors for pallette
