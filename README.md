Artist portfolio for Nate Colton

Github pages url: https://boulderbrains.github.io/BoldBackwoods/

Instructions from Nate:
- I would like would be a home page, portfolio, bio/profile, and links to my IG, FB, and Etsy.
- Color pallette: black, greys, browns, and gold

I’m attaching my logo in all of the formats that I have, as well as pictures of pieces that I’ve done, focusing on the woodburning/pyrography for now.

To do list:
- Come up with defined hex colors for pallette
- Implement an instagram feed
	This is one option: http://instafeedjs.com/

Questions for Nate: 
- Do you have a written biography about yourself and artwork?
- Do you have a specific font you want to use for the Bold Backwood text? If not check out google fonts and let me know if you see anything. https://fonts.google.com/
	- A good thing to do is look up font pairings that work well together, header font and body text font. 2 is usually good.
